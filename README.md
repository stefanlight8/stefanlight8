# Stefan Mukhin
#### also known as stefanlight
Ordinary Junior developer. I've been familiar with computers since 2017, and with development and design since 2020. I engage in graphic/web design, photography, and sometimes work with sound, video. All of this can be summed up as creativity.
Over all the time I've spent on the computer, I created more than 30 full-fledged projects that have garnered their own community and had pluses.
I have my own approach to development and I love it when everything is by the rules, everything works like clockwork, and even the code itself looks good.

- Currently working on [Shinshi](https://github.com/ShinshiDevs/Shinshi).
- My main language is Python already 4 years.
- In my plans to try Rust, Golang, learn more in Linux, Docker.
